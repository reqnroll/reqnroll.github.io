We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

One notable statistic from June is that the six-week NuGet package downloads reached half the number of downloads of SpecFlow. This is especially interesting because the number of SpecFlow NuGet package downloads has not decreased significantly (dropping from 2.9M to 2.4M since last September), so this figure is the result of an increased number of Reqnroll downloads. NuGet package downloads represent the presence of passive usage ‚Äî a project that is not in active development might still have a CI build that periodically downloads the packages. This could explain the steady number of SpecFlow package downloads. However, if these projects are at least in maintenance mode and we see an increasing number of Reqnroll downloads, this indicates that Reqnroll is not only being adopted by existing SpecFlow projects but also by brand new projects. In other words, a significant portion of Reqnroll usage comes from new projects and not just from SpecFlow migrations.

Another figure worth noting is the decreasing number of Rider extension usages. I don't yet know if this is a real decrease or just a problem with how we collect telemetry data. We still need to figure that out.
