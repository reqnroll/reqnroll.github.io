I'm proudly announcing that the first version of Reqnroll has been released: v1.0.0 ([Release notes](https://go.reqnroll.net/release-notes)).

<!--more-->

For the background and motivation of the [Reqnroll project]({{ site.url }}), please check our [intro post]({{ site.url }}/news/2024/02/from-specflow-to-reqnroll-why-and-how/).

This first release is based on SpecFlow v4 beta and contains all improvements of that. It also includes a SpecFlow compatibility package that can be used to migrate SpecFlow projects in minutes. Please check out our detailed [migration guide](https://go.reqnroll.net/guide-migrating-from-specflow).

Reqnroll has been published through nuget.org and in order to install it, you only need to add a NuGet package reference. Please check out [project setup guide](https://go.reqnroll.net/doc-setup-project) for the detailed setup instructions.

By adding Reqnroll integration to your IDE, like Visual Studio 2022, you can work even faster with Reqnroll. Please check our [IDE setup guide](https://go.reqnroll.net/doc-setup-ide) for the instruction details.

If you are new to Reqnroll & SpecFlow, we recommend going through our [Quickstart](https://go.reqnroll.net/quickstart) guide that helps you step-by-step to have your first Reqnroll project.

Our more complex sample application, [ReqOverflow](https://github.com/reqnroll/Sample-ReqOverflow) has also been published. It can be used as a more complex showcase with domain-call, REST API and Web UI automation examples.

For all the features and integrations of the project, please check out the [documentation](https://docs.reqnroll.net/).

Reqnroll is free, but we provide dedicated support through our [paid subscription packages]({{ site.url }}/support/). Purchasing them will also support the [sustainability of the open-source project](https://go.reqnroll.net/sustainability).

If you find any issues or have ideas, please use our [community support channels](https://go.reqnroll.net/community-support) to report them.
