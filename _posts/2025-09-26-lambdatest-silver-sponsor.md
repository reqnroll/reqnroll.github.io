I am happy to announce that [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) has become a Silver Sponsor of Reqnroll! 🎉

They have committed to supporting us with $600/year, which is a great help in covering our costs. We have already updated our [sponsorship page](https://reqnroll.net/sponsorship/) and the project [README file on GitHub](https://github.com/reqnroll/Reqnroll/blob/main/README.md) to display their sponsorship.

Please check out their short introduction below. For more information, please visit [www.lambdatest.com](https://www.lambdatest.com/).
