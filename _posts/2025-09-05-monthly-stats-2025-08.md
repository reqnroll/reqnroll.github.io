We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

We have released the long-awaited [v3 of Reqnroll](2025-08-21-reqnroll-v3-0-released-with-reporting.md) on the 21st of August. Although we have only 10 days of usage statistics from v3, we have already generated more than 5,000 reports!

Note: We have [released v3.0.1](https://github.com/reqnroll/Reqnroll/releases/tag/v3.0.1) today with a few small bug fixes. Please upgrade to v3.0.1.

üì¢ I encourage everyone to invite contributors for a coffee üçµ. That could help pay our hosting bills or even enable us to organize an in-person design workshop to better align our goals (and drink those coffees, of course. Maybe a beer üç∫ too...).
