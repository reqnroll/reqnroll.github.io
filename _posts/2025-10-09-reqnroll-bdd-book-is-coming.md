We're excited to announce that a new BDD book is coming that features Reqnroll examples! [**"Effective Behavior-Driven Development"**](https://www.manning.com/books/effective-behavior-driven-development?utm_source=nagy&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_nagy&a_aid=nagy&a_bid=135b848a&chan=mm_rnr) by G치sp치r Nagy and Seb Rose is being published by Manning Publications.

## About the Book

This is the first BDD book that, while remaining tool-agnostic, uses Reqnroll examples to illustrate automation concepts. The book is structured in three comprehensive parts:

1. **Discovery** - Understanding BDD concepts and how to better understand requirements for a more seamless development flow
2. **Formulation** - Writing understandable and maintainable BDD scenarios in Gherkin using `Given`, `When`, and `Then` keywords
3. **Automation Patterns** - Core BDD automation concepts and patterns that improve your BDD automation solution

## Preview and Special Offer

The book is currently in preview state with the first 5 chapters available (more comes soon!). Manning is offering an introductory sale with **50% discount** for early adopters.

**Shameless plug alert**: One of the authors is me (G치sp치r Nagy), so this is definitely a shameless plug! 游땕
