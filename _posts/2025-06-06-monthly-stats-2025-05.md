We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

You may have noticed that I forgot to publish the statistics for April on time. We have had busy months preparing for our next major release, but I will make a separate post about that.

Perhaps the most notable figure in the statistics for May is that the number of Reqnroll Visual Studio extension installations has nearly reached 20K. This represents how many times our latest VS extension has been installed or upgraded. Of course, this may include users who simply "hit & run," but together with the number of Reqnroll projects (16K) we can confidently say that our user base is well above ten thousand. That is a great achievement.

It is also interesting to see that, over the past two months, India and the USA have risen to the top in terms of usage. As I mentioned earlier, this may be a sign that more and more large enterprises are adopting Reqnroll.
