We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

In September, we can see that the monthly stats have been restored to their original levels after the lower activity of August and have continued the increase we saw before.

The most interesting thing this month is probably how the new integration options have started to get used.

Although the number is still low, Reqnroll is already being used with the .NET 10 release candidate. The final version of .NET 10 will be released in November, and Reqnroll does not have any reported issues with it. That's good news.

In v3.0 and v3.1, we introduced integration with two new test execution frameworks: TUnit and xUnit v3. Their usage is still below 1%, but they are already visible in the statistics.

In the August report, we had just seen the first numbers related to the new reporting features of Reqnroll. This month, we already see bigger numbers. Almost 3% of all projects already use reporting. It's also good to see that the first 3rd party formatter tool, [Expressium](https://github.com/ExpressiumOSS/Expressium.LivingDoc), is already visible in the stats. (Expressium is a free, open-source project for generating living documentation.)

It's not related to the statistics, but it's worth noting that the [Available plugins](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/integrations/available-plugins.html) page in the documentation has been improved. If you are the author of a Reqnroll plugin, make sure you send a PR to have your plugin listed there as well.

üì¢ I encourage everyone to invite contributors for a coffee üçµ. That could help pay our hosting bills or even enable us to organize an in-person design workshop to better align our goals (and drink those coffees, of course. Maybe a beer üç∫ too...).
