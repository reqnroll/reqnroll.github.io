We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

Many of us expected December to be a calm month for Reqnroll. However, on December 17th, the [SpecFlow open-source project suddenly disappeared from GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gasparnagy_github-reqnrollreqnroll-open-source-cucumber-style-activity-7274869345271312384-Avos?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). This made it clear to many that Tricentis was no longer interested in continuing the project. It is still unknown why they removed the GitHub project without any prior notice (they could have just marked the project as "archived"). A few days later, the project reappeared (without issues) with an [end-of-life announcement](https://support-hub.tricentis.com/open?number=NEW0001432&id=post) scheduled by the end of the year. Indeed, the project [finally disappeared from GitHub on January 1st](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gasparnagy_my-domain-registration-for-reqnrollnet-has-activity-7280177083673104386-Gw3-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

Not surprisingly, interest in the migration guide surged, and in December, it became the most visited documentation page, with record peaks between December 18-20.
