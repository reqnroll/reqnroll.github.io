I am excited to announce that Bas Dijkstra has created a comprehensive, freely available online video tutorial on Reqnroll! üéì

<!--more-->

The course, titled "[Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) with Reqnroll](https://ontestautomation.teachable.com/p/behaviour-driven-development-bdd-with-reqnroll)", provides **over 60 minutes of content** that takes you through the fundamentals of Reqnroll and how to effectively use it for BDD in your projects.

## What's covered in the tutorial?

The tutorial provides a thorough overview of both BDD concepts and practical Reqnroll usage:

* **The BDD Process**
  * The three stages of the BDD process
  * Discovery and Example Mapping
  * Formulation and Gherkin
  * Automation and Reqnroll

* **Working with Reqnroll**
  * Creating tests from scenarios
  * Improving your step definitions
  * Working with tables
  * Hooks and tags
  * Implementing acceptance tests for UI and API
  * Continuous Integration

The course uses a real-world example of a loan application processing service for an online banking application, following the feature from initial request through testing to release readiness.
