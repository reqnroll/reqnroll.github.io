We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

If you examine the statistics carefully, you can observe what appears to be the _first significant wave of SpecFlow project migrations_. This can be inferred from the NuGet download statistics (we reached 11% of SpecFlow downloads over the last 6 weeks), as well as the sudden rise in the usage of .NET Framework 4.8, which jumped to second place with 25%, up from fourth place at just 3% in June.

We also observed continuous growth in test executions, which reached nearly 1.5M in September.
