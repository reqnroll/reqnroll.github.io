We believe transparency is important to build a trustworthy open-source community, so we regularly share our usage and sustainability statistics.

Below are some statistics we found interesting (in parentheses, you can see the figures for the previous month). If you are interested in any other figures, please let us know.

## Featured Topic of the Month

In March, the stats indicate that the user base stabilization phase of Reqnroll has started. We still see constant growth, but (as expected) the era of exponential changes is probably over. The change in the SpecFlow-Reqnroll NuGet package download ratio from 30% to 37% is still significant, showing that projects are continuing to migrate.

There are a couple of figures, though, that have remained fairly stable over the last few months. One of these is the median number of test executions per project, which is consistently around 50. This number shows that an "average" Reqnroll project was executed 50 times in a month. To be precise, it means that half of the projects were run ‚â§ 50 times and the other half were run ‚â• 50 times. The stability of this number shows that many projects fall within this mid-range. Around 40% of the execution runs are on CI/CD pipelines (new stat!), meaning that out of the 50 executions, 20 are on CI/CD. This is almost exactly the number of weekdays in a month! So we can say that most projects have a CI/CD pipeline with at least a daily check. Is this good news? Good question. But if you don't have a CI/CD pipeline, it's definitely time to catch up now!

üì¢ I encourage everyone to invite contributors for a coffee üçµ. That could help pay our hosting bills or even enable us to organize an in-person design workshop to better align our goals (and drink those coffees, of course. Maybe a beer üç∫ too...).
