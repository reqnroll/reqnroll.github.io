**Reqnroll** (pronounced as \[reknroʊl\]) is an open-source Cucumber-style BDD test automation framework for .NET. It has been created as a reboot of the SpecFlow project.

Reqnroll enables writing executable specifications for BDD using [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/), the widely-accepted _feature file_ specification format. With that you can define the requirements using _Given-When-Then_ style _scenarios_ and turn them to automated tests in order to verify their implementation.

Reqnroll works on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), on all commonly used .NET implementations (including .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET 8.0). For executing the automated scenarios, Reqnroll can use [MsTest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest), [NUnit](https://nunit.org/) or [xUnit](https://xunit.net/). You can work on Reqnroll projects using Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Core and Rider, but you can also use Reqnroll without any IDE.

The Reqnroll project has been initiated by Gaspar Nagy, the creator and main contributor of SpecFlow. Gaspar's company, [Spec Solutions](https://www.specsolutions.eu/) has been sponsoring his efforts, but **Reqnroll is an independent project that is owned and supported by the community**. The legal assets of the project are going to be transferred to a foundation, but Gaspar is committed to keep working on the project.

## Relation to SpecFlow

Reqnroll has been created based on the SpecFlow open-source codebase to provide an actively maintained BDD solution for teams and projects working on the Microsoft .NET platform.

We respect and appreciate all efforts, contribution and sponsorship that have been made to SpecFlow since its birth in 2009.

## Relation to Cucumber

Reqnroll is a member of the Cucumber tool family. Reqnroll can be seen as a .NET port of Cucumber because they use the same specification language (Gherkin) and follow the same automation concept.

We work closely together with the Cucumber team and support each other.

## Sustainability

No open-source project can be actively maintained without the support and the sponsorship of the community. **We all have to work together to keep these open-source projects alive.**

**We are committed to keep Reqnroll free.** In order to achieve this, we are planning to pursue the following strategy:

*   We expect users to contribute to the project by analyzing and fixing bugs, implementing features and improving the documentation. We work hard to provide compensation for their efforts.
*   We accept donations from individuals. Details to be announced soon.
*   We encourage larger companies (>20 devs/testers) or companies which work with large Reqnroll solution (>500 scenario) to consider our [paid subscription packages]({{ site.url }}/support/). The income of these packages is used to finance the project and the contributors. Please check out our [Support]({{ site.url }}/support/) page for details.
*   We offer sponsorship packages for companies who would like to have visibility on our website.
*   We expect that all businesses that make commercial products or services for Reqnroll (e.g. commercial test tools integrating with Reqnroll; Reqnroll trainings) contribute to the project either by sponsorship or by active contribution in the open-source code. We are happy to provide visibility for those observing this ethical guideline.

In case you have any questions about our sustainability model or would be interested in our sponsorship package, please [contact us]({{ site.url }}/contact/).
