## Sponsorship Model

Reqnroll is an open-source project owned and maintained by the community. Project sponsors play an important role to provide sustainability for the project. We are thankful for any one-time or recurring donations.

We accept sponsorship in various different forms, but particularly:

*   Recurring or one-time contribution with money (we accept USD and EUR)
*   Offering workforce, by offering fixed or recurring man-hours of work from the employees of the sponsoring company
*   Offering licenses or other benefits for the key contributors of the project

Regardless of the form of the contribution, we always calculate the yearly value of the sponsorship in USD to make them comparable. For workforce, we use a fixed rate of USD 80 / h for the calculation; for licenses the yearly license price (calculated based on 3 years of usage).

Based on the yearly value, we provide 4 sponsorship tiers:

*   **Supporter** (yearly contribution: below USD 600)
    *   The name of the supporter is listed on the website’s sponsoring page

*   **Silver Sponsor** (yearly contribution: between USD 600 and USD 5400)
    *   The name & the logo of the sponsor is listed on the website’s sponsoring page as link
    *   3 randomly selected silver sponsor is listed on the project home page (re-randomized for every page load)
    *   The name & link of the sponsor is listed in the GitHub README.md (without logo)

*   **Gold Sponsor** (yearly contribution: between USD 5400 and USD 18 000)
    *   The benefits of Silver tier, plus
    *   The sponsor is always visible on the website homepage
    *   The sponsor is included in GitHub README.md with logo
    *   A short promo text (max 100 words) can be included in the sponsor page
    *   The sponsor can provide 1 guest blog post per year that is published on the Reqnroll website and promoted on social channels

*   **Platinum Sponsor** (yearly contribution: above USD 18 000)
    *   The benefits of Gold tier, plus
    *   Extra highlight of the sponsorship level in all lists (listed as platinum sponsor before gold and silver sponsors; bigger logo)
    *   Handling of special sponsor requests

## How to become a sponsor

We provide various channels to accept donations:

*   GitHub Sponsors (USD): [https://github.com/sponsors/reqnroll](https://github.com/sponsors/reqnroll)
*   Open Source Collective (USD): [https://opencollective.com/reqnroll](https://opencollective.com/reqnroll)
*   EUR-based channel: hopefully soon...

The money collected through GitHub Sponsors is managed by our Open Source Collective account. Open Source Collective is an `501 (c)(6)` organization.

If you wish to sponsor Reqnroll in another way or have any questions about sponsorship, please contact us at pr \[at\] reqnroll.net.

## Spending the money we have received

The money we collect from the sponsors (or the profit of the paid subscription packages) are spent for the following goals:

*   **Operational costs:** website hosting, domain fee, additional build agents, administration costs, etc. (expected: <$2000 / year)
*   **Marketing:** producing and distributing marketing material, like stickers, t-shirts, etc. (expected <$2000 / year)
*   **Contributor connections:** Helping key contributors to meet (e.g. supporting them to attend a conference and meet other contributors) (expected: <$20 000 / year)
*   **Contributor compensation:** Pay compensation for open source contributors for their work (budget: as needed and lasts, target: $80/h gross)
*   **Paid workforce for special feature implementations:** hire experts for helping with concrete tasks (budget: ad hoc)

For all spendings we provide full transparency through our financial hosts: [Open Source Collective (USD)](https://opencollective.com/reqnroll) and Open Collective Europe (EUR).
